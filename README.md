# TestOurBotsWiki.github.io
This repository was too old to exist in testourbots so it now was moved to here.
Why you ask?
* It was too old and people were forking it without permission.
* It wasn't updated (4 months old)
* I was bored so much that I was working on a project which I have to be secret with (secret because I know most people will be racist of the project (it isn't on meme20200, mine20200 or anything that is publicly owned by me))
